# newsletter
https://github.com/diegoleonardoro/newsletter/blob/main/newsletterbackend.ts

This class integrates MongoDB for data storage, Redis for caching, and SendGrid for email services. It includes:

- Asynchronous operations.
- Data processing.
- Integration with external services.

**Key Technologies:**
- MongoDB
- Redis
- SendGrid
- TypeScript
- UUID

**Class Structure: NewsletterRepository**

**Constructor:**

Database Connection: Establishes a connection to MongoDB using a helper function connectToDatabase.

Redis Connection: Sets up a Redis client and attempts to connect, logging the connection status.

**Methods:**

- **fetchSubscribers:** Fetches subscribers from MongoDB whose newsletters are due based on frequency settings. It uses a MongoDB query that checks if the time since the last sent newsletter is greater than the subscribed frequency.

- **fetchAllSubscribers**: Retrieves all subscribers with a specific email from MongoDB, demonstrating how to filter documents in MongoDB.

- **sendEmails**: Constructs and sends emails to the list of subscribers using SendGrid. It also updates the lastSent date in MongoDB, demonstrating integration with an email service and subsequent database update.

- **updateLastSent**: Updates the lastSent field for a batch of subscribers in MongoDB after sending emails.

- **formatCallToHTML and formatPermitToHTML**: Converts data entries into HTML formatted strings for email content, formatting data in a more human-readable form.

- **fetchDataFromRedis**: Retrieves and decompresses data from Redis, handling binary data and asynchronous decompression.

- **subscribeToNewsletter**: Allows a new subscriber to sign up for the newsletter, demonstrating document insertion in MongoDB and basic conditional logic to handle existing data.

- **sendReferralEmail**: Sends a one-time referral email to a user, integrating SendGrid for email operations.

- **updateUsers**: Either updates all users with a new UUID or a specific user with provided data.

- **geoBasedNewsLetter**: Fethces data, procceses it and emails based on geographic data. It combines data handling, error management, and complex business logic.

- **getUserInfo**: Retrieves a specific user's data based on an identifier, illustrating data retrieval for individual records.

**Key Concepts Illustrated:**

Asynchronous Programming.

Error Handling.

Data Caching and Decompression.

Integration with External APIs.
